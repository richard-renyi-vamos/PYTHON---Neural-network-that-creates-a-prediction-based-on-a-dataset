Sure! I can provide you with a simple example of creating a neural network in Python using the popular library TensorFlow/Keras to make predictions based on a dataset. For this example, let's assume you have a dataset with features and corresponding labels, and you want to train a neural network to predict the labels based on the features.

First, make sure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed. You can install them via pip if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras
Now, here's a simple example of creating and training a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example dataset (replace with your own dataset)
# Let's say you have features X and labels y
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 5 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Binary labels (0 or 1)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'),  # Input layer
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output layer
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
In this example:

We generate a random dataset with 5 features and binary labels.
We split the dataset into training and testing sets.
We create a simple neural network model with one input layer, one hidden layer with 10 neurons using ReLU activation function, and one output layer with one neuron using the sigmoid activation function.
We compile the model with Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function.
We train the model on the training data for 10 epochs.
We evaluate the model on the testing data.
Finally, we make predictions using the trained model.
You can replace the example dataset with your own dataset and adjust the architecture of the neural network according to your problem.
